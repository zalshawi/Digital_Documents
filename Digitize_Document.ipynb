Costs of the Application be in the cause.The application is supported by the affidavit of MichaelMabikke, the applicant/ appellant.The respondent opposed the application and its Director FrankNigel Othembi filed an affidavit in reply.BACKGROUND TO THE APPLICATION.The applicant, Michael Mabikke is a legal practitioner. He wasawarded a post graduate diploma in legal practice in 2010 bythe respondent. In due course, there emerged allegations andcomplaints of examination malpractices concerning academicyears 2004/2005 to 2010/2011. On receipt of thesecomplaints, the management of the respondent appointed anAudit Committee to carry out a forensic audit of theexaminations covered in.After the exercise, the committee produced an audit reportindicating examination improprieties regarding the PostGraduate Bar Course examinations over the said period.When management considered the Report, it set up aCommittee to conduct a detailed inquiry into specific cases ofsuspected examination malpractices and to review therecommendations of the forensic Audit Committee Report inconnection with possible examination malpractices.In 2013, the applicant and others filed an application in theHigh Court for judicial review seeking a number of reliefsamong which was an order of certiorari to quash the report ofthe Forensic Audit of the Bar Course Examination for theperiod 2004/2005 to 2010/2011 and an order of prohibitionand injunction to stop the committee set up by managementfrom conducting a detailed inquiry into possible examinationmal-practices and reviewing the recommendations of the3\\x0cforensic Audit Committee, The High Court declined to grant theorders for which the applicants prayed. The appellant thenappealed to the Court of Appeal which appeal was dismissed.Dissatisfied with the decision, the applicant lodged a Notice ofAppeal in this court, an application for stay of execution andan application for admitting additional evidence on courtrecord which is the subject of this ruling.Grounds of the application.The Notice of Motion contained 35 grounds which we foundrepetitive. They are basically as follows;1. That the Applicant /Appellant being dissatisfied with thejudgment of the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No. 51 of2013 Hon. Mukasa Mbidde & Hon. Michael Mabikke VsThe Law Development Centre Holden at Kampala deliveredon the 14% Day of May 2015 intends to appeal against thesaid judgment /decision to the Supreme Court of Uganda.2.That the Applicant /Appellant having been dissatisfiedwith the said judgment filed a Notice of Appeal against thesaid decision on the 18th May 2013.3.That the Applicant /Appellant is in the process ofcompiling the certified copy of Record of Proceedings ofThe High Court and Court of Appeal and eventually file arecord of appeal including the memorandum of appeal inthe Supreme Court.4. That the new and important evidence has been discoveredwhich shows that contrary to the respondent’s evidence atthe trial and preliminary hearing in the High Court and inthe Court of Appeal , that no final decision had been takenby the respondent to cancel the Applicant’s /Appellant’sdiploma in legal practice without giving him an4\\x0c14212835opportunity to be heard, a final decision was taken on TheReport of the Forensic Audit of the Bar CourseExamination for the period 2004/2005 to 2010/2011 andThe Report of the Sub Committee of the Respondent dated30% November 2015 whereby the respondent’sManagement Committee sitting on the 11% February 2016resolved to cancel the applicant’s/Appellant’s Diploma inLegal Practice without due process, which cancellation theApplicant/Appellant only learnt of through the New VisionNewspaper dated 26th February 2016, where therespondent communicated the same in a press release.-That the said additional evidence was not in theapplicant’s knowledge by the time he had his matter heardin the high Court and his appeal in the Court of Appealand could not be obtained even with exercise ofreasonable diligence as the respondent through its SubCommittees was still allegedly investigating Examinationmalpractices in the Law Development Centre.. That the minutes of the Law Development Centre SubCommittee and the management Committee of the lawDevelopment center were only in the possession andknowledge of the respondent until when theApplicant/Appellant wrote a letter to be availed the sameReport on the 26t August 2016 and the Secretary /HeadHuman Resource and Administration only wrote back tothe Applicant /Appellant and availed him copies of thesame report on the 16th September 2016..The respondent through its management committeearbitrarily, unconstitutionally breached its duty of fairnessin reaching a decision to cancel the applicant’s/appellant’s Diploma in Legal Practice based on suspicions\\x0c14212835without concrete evidence of the alleged examinationmalpractices.- Investigations by the Sub Committees commissioned bythe respondent from 2013 and in particular 2015 toinvestigate allegations of examination malpractices at theRespondent for the period 2004-2011 based on ForensicAudit Report (FAR) for the said period did not make anyvalid findings of irregularities in its report dated 30thNovember 2015 or at all to justify the decision taken bythe respondent to cancel the applicant’s award of the PostGraduate Diploma in Legal Practice and the Respondentshall be put to strict proof for the legal basis of its saiddecision.. The said Sub Committees were not duly constituted inaccordance with the provisions of the Law DevelopmentAct and the Regulations governing the passing of the BarCourse.10.The applicant has never been given any opportunity of afair hearing during the course of the proceedings of the saidcommittees.11.The said Forensic report recommended criminalprosecution and withdrawal of the applicant’s Diploma inLegal Practice and in Uganda one does not have a BarCourse Diploma Certificate from the respondent.12.Even if the Applicant was meticulous in his gathering ofevidence to support his case, he could not have access tothe said evidence as it was in the possession of therespondent at the time of filing and hearing of theapplication for the Judicial Review in The High Court andthe Appeal in the Court of Appeal.\\x0c1421283513. That the further evidence sought to be adduced is crucialand very necessary for the Applicant’s case as he is askingthe Supreme Court to rule on power of the LawDevelopment Centre to recall and investigate and cancel hisqualifications without affording a right of hearing andfollowing the Rules governing the Passing of the Bar Courseand rules of natural justice.14.The said very important evidence is contrary to therespondent’s claim and clearly shows that a final decisionto cancel the applicant’s Diploma in Legal practice hasindeed been taken by the respondent without affording aright of hearing and following the Rules of Natural justice.15.That the Respondent’s Management Committee issued areport on the 30% day of November 2015 wherein theyrecommended the cancellation of the Applicant’s PostGraduate Diploma in Legal Practice and addressed theirreport to the Law Council, Uganda Law Society, HighCourt, Ministry of Justice amongst other bodies whichbodies have undertaken process of enforcing the decisionas the Secretariat of the Law Council through the LawSociety inviting the Applicant to attend a meeting on the28 of September 2016.16.The additional evidence is necessary to the applicant’scase since the thrust of the respondent’s case in the lowercourts was that he Respondent did not revoke theApplicant’s Diploma in Legal Practice, but was merelyconducting an investigation and or fact finding missionafter which the applicant would be given opportunity to beheard.\\x0c14212817.That if the evidence is not allowed, it will leave therespondent’s affidavits and testimonies in the High Courtand the Court of Appela about the cancellation of theApplicant’s Diploma in Legal practice unchallenged tostand as the truth whereas not.18.That the further evidence is to clarify about the Applicantand this Honorable Court being the last court of instance,it would be pertinent that it is admitted in order to meetthe ends of justice, reach a fair and just decision and avoida multiplicity of proceedings.19.That the further evidence is credible since it has beenobtained from the Respondent’s secretary/ Head HumanResource and Administration letter dated 16 September2016 and that this application has been without unduedelay in less than sixty days of obtaining certified copies ofthe record of proceedings form the Court of Appeal which isin the process of being compiled to allow the applicant filehis Record and Memorandum of Appeal in the SupremeCourt.20. That the respondent is not likely to suffer any injustice orprejudice if this application is granted since the newevidence is a record of their own proceedings of the SubCommittee and the Minutes of the Law Development CentreManagement Committee.21.That it is fair, just and equitable and in the interest ofjustice that the application be granted.The application is supported by an affidavit affirmed by theApplicant.\\x0c1421.2835RepresentationThe applicant was represented by Mr. Semuyaba Justinwhereas the respondent was represented by Mr. TibaijukaCharles.SubmissionsAppellant.The appellant’s counsel submitted that the application isseeking this honorable court to allow the applicant to adduceThe Report of the Subcommittee of the Management Committeeof the Respondent dated 30th November 2015 and the Minutesof the Pamela Committee as new evidence to elucidate on theReport of the Forensic Audit of the Bar Course Examination forthe period 2004/2005 to 2010/2011. He stated that thisevidence is crucial and was not available during theproceedings in the High Court and the Court of Appeal.Counsel further submitted that the Supreme Court is the lastcourt of instance in the instant matter therefore admittingfurther evidence on record shall assist the Supreme Court todetermine the dispute once and for all.Counsel relied on the case of AG & IGG Vs Afric CooperativeSociety Ltd Mise Applen .No 06 of 2012 in which theSupreme Court exercised its inherent powers to do justiceunder Rule 2(2) of the Rules of the court, notwithstanding theprovisions of Rule 30 which would appear to deny thediscretion of this court to admit additional evidence.Counsel submitted that Rule 2(2) of the Rules of this courtderives from the Section 98 of the Civil Procedure Act whichsaves the inherent powers of Court which provisions arereinforced by Article 126(1) and (2) of the Constitution.Counsel stated that in AG & IGG Vs Afric CooperativeSociety the Supreme Court relied on the observations ofJustice Oder in GM Combined Limited Vs A.K. Detergents9\\x0c14212335SCCA No. 07 of 1998 where he said the evidence which merelyelucidates on evidence already on record is not additionalevidence.Counsel further invited court to consider the holding in thecase of AG Vs The East African Law Society & Anor AppealNo. 1 of 2013 where court held that the new evidence wouldpresumably add to the quality and quantity of the evidencealready filed on court record. To that extent, that was nodifferent, in its effect from adducing “more and_ betterparticulars” of the evidence already adduced and recorded inthe prior proceedings.Counsel further submitted that in exercising their discretion,their lordships are advancing the cause of the first and greatestcommandment of this court namely; to do justice withoutundue regard to technicalities under Article 126(2) (e) of theConstitution.Counsel further relied on the case of Anifa Kawoya BangiranaVs National Council For Higher Education Misc ApplicationNo. 8 of 2013, where court observed that it was satisfied thatthe evidence which the applicant sought to adduce was not inher knowledge at the time of filing the Constitutional Petitionand could not have become aware of it even if she had beenprudent in gathering evidence to support her case. Theevidence was not only relevant to the issues for determination,but also credible and capable of having an influence on theresult of the appeal.Counsel submitted that the applicant had applied to this courtfor an interim stay of execution vide Mise Application No. 15of 2015 where Justice Tumwesigye JSC observed that no courtwill condone cancellation of any body’s diploma withoutallowing them their right to be heard which decision therespondent failed to take heed of. He stated that while theapplicant/appellant was in the process of filing a Record and10\\x0c14212835Memorandum of Appeal in the Supreme court , he was invitedby the respondent’s Sub Committee investigating Examinationmalpractices where he appeared before the same however thecommittee acted contrary to Justice Tumwesigye’s ruling.He stated that there was nexus between the report of the SubCommittee of the Management Committee of the Respondentdated 30% November 2015 and the Report of The ForensicAudit of the Bar Course Examination for the Period 2004/2005to 2010/2011 already filed in the High Court and the Court ofAppeal. He submitted that Hon. Justice V.T Zehukirize in theHigh Court held that the Forensic Bar Course Examination forthe period 2004/2005 to 2010/2011 was a mere fact findingbody and was not obliged to give the applicant/ appellant aright to be heard.He stated that the new important further evidence which hasbeen discovered shows that contrary to the evidence adducedby the Respondent in the preliminary hearing, trial Court andCourt of Appeal that no final decision had been taken on TheReport of The Forensic Audit of the Bar Course Examination forthe Period 2004/2005 to 2010/2011 arising from The Report ofthe Sub Committee of The Management Committee of theRespondent dated 30 November 2015 where the respondent’sManagement Committee sitting on the 11th February 2016resolved to cancel the Diploma in Legal practice without dueprocess, which cancellation the Applicant only learnt ofthrough the New Vision Newspaper dated 26th February 2016,where the respondent communicated the same in a pressrelease.He submitted that the said new evidence was not in theknowledge of the applicant at the time the matter was heard inthe High Court and the Court of Appeal and could not beobtained even with exercise of reasonable diligence as therespondent through its Subcommittee was. still allegedly11\\x0c142123a5investigating Examination malpractices in the LawDevelopment Centre. That the minutes and proceedings of theDr. Pamela Committee wherein they recommended thecancellation of the post graduate diploma in Legal Practice wereonly in the knowledge and possession of the Respondent untilwhen the applicant wrote a letter to be availed the same Reporton 26% August 2016 and the Secretary / Head HumanResource and Administration only wrote back and availed thesame report to the applicant on the 16th September 2016.Counsel submitted that along with the report was furtherevidence that Ezadri Micheal Onyafia, Lutalo Kizito, Hon. FredMukasa Mbidde , Nakalembe Jacquline Evelyn, Kagoro FridayRoberts and Kataike Florence who also sat for and completedthe Diploma in Legal practice and were graduated on 3rdSeptember 2010 were allowed to sit special examinations andwere again awarded the same diplomas that were previouslyawarded to them in the year 2010.He avers that the respondent addressed its report cancellingthe applicant’s diploma in legal practice to the Law Council,Uganda Law Society, High Court, Ministry of justice, amongstother bodies which have the authority to implement therespondent’s decision. That there is a pending appeal in theSupreme Court and there is a serious threat of executing andimplementing the recommendations of the Report yet thehearing and final determination of the said appeal in theSupreme Court is still pending.But rather shall elucidate on the report already on record andits admission would avoid a multiplicity of proceedingsotherwise there will be no end to litigation. That the applicantappeared before the Committee interactively and there was noaccuser or accusation neither were there specific chargesagainst him nor elaborate procedures envisaged under ahearing. He stated that Section 16(1) of the Law Development12\\x0c14ai.2835Centre Act is to the effect that the Dr. Pamela Committee couldnot purport to have conducted a hearing as doing so would bein excess of its jurisdiction. That Rule 21(2) of the RulesGoverning the Passing of the Bar Course, 2010 enjoins theManagement committee to exercise its powers judiciously.He further stated that the new evidence does not introduce anew cause of action as it arose out of the recommendations ofthe Report of the Forensic Audit of the bar Course Examinationfor the period 2004/2005 to 2010/2011 and the latter report isa continuation of the former. That the respondent through itsManagement Sub Committee acted arbitrarily and breached itsduty of fairness in reaching the decision of cancelling of theapplicant’s diploma in legal practice. Counsel argued that evenif the respondent was to apply the Regulations Governing thePassing of the Bar Course 2002 which came into force on the3rd May 2002, they do not have a provision for the particularBar Course Examination Malpractice on this matter.He submitted that the Law Development Act conferred powersupon The Management Committee to make Rules which it didand the rules created a verification Committee, Examiner’sBoard and an Appeals Committee and it is improper to delegatethe duties of those committees to improper committees like theForensic Audit Committee and a Sub Committee not properlyconstituted. That their actions were ultravires under theprinciple of delegatus non potest delegare.That it is in the interest of justice that the new evidence beallowed so as to elucidate on the evidence already on courtrecord and enable this court to make an informed finding forjustice to prevail. The applicant proposed that court should notclose its eyes to the raised issues of illegality in the newevidence.Counsel concluded by praying court to allow the applicant/appellant’s application seeking to be allowed to adduce further13\\x0c14212835evidence in form of The Report of the Sub Committee of theManagement Committee of the Respondent dated 30thNovember 2015 Volume I, 11A and IIB and the Minutes of theProceedings of the Dr. Pamela Committee.RespondentCounsel for the respondent opposed the application to adducefurther evidence on Appeal in the Supreme Court. Counselargued that the Supreme Court does not have discretion totake additional evidence in ordinary appeal originating from theHigh court as the court of first instance (second Appeals), buthas such discretion in Constitutional Appeals originating fromthe Constitutional Court( first appeals). That in second appeal,this Honorable court must address two questions ie whether ithas power to take additional evidence, and whether thecircumstances of particular cases warrant the taking of suchevidence.Counsel argued that this court in the past has had a tendencyof mixing up constitutional appeals with ordinary appeals andin the process, a wrong impression has been created that r.30(1) which prohibits the taking of additional evidence inordinary Appeals is easily displaced by inherent powersconferred by r.2(2). He argued that the authorities relied on bythe applicant ie AG VS Paul Kawanga Semogerere & ors(Supra) and Hon Anifa Bangirana Kawooya Vs NationalCouncil for Higher Education SC Misc Appln. No. 8 of 2013are Constitutional Appeals and this court had express powersto take additional evidence. That the instant case is thereforedistinguishable.Counsel stated that the Semogerere (supra) casc wasdismissed therefore all observations made therein are abiterdicta. That this implies that the court in the case of Anifakawooya (Supra) relied on obiter dicta14\\x0c14212835Counsel further referred court to General Industries (U) ltd VsNonperforming Assets Recovery Trust [1999] KALR 400where Mulenga JSC (RIP) held that;“This court has no jurisdiction to take additional evidence.The Appellant’s suggestion that this court invokesinherent powers to do so, is untenable because the courtcannot use a general power set out in one rule to do whatis specifically forbidden in another rule.”Counsel further submitted that assuming this court haspowers to take additional evidence in the present case, thereare no exceptional circumstances to warrant the taking of suchevidence because of the following reasons;That there was no discovery of new and important evidence. Heargued that the applicant having realized that his case asoriginally filed can no longer give him an effective remedy, hisstrategy is now to argue out a new case that was not before thelower courts and seek for remedies that were not sought in thelower courts.That much as it is true that a final decision has been taken bythe respondent against the applicant, this new developmentdoes not in any way elucidate the Audit Report that was beforethe two lower courts and consequently additional evidence isnot called for. Nor is court misled in any way by the absence ofsuch evidence.He argued that reviewing the audit report was just one amongother Terms of Reference (TOR) of the DR. Pamela Committeewhich Committee extended to making its own independentinvestigation and its own report therefore there was no nexusbetween the two reports.Counsel submitted that the new evidence has no relevance tothe issues before the lower courts and the applicant simplywants to use such evidence to pursue new issues or causes of15\\x0c14242835action arising from the Dr. Pamela Committee. He argued thatin the High Court, the applicant challenged the appointment ofthe Kania Committee and the report of the Forensic committee.That the Pamela Committee stayed its proceedings until afterthe conclusion of the case in the Court of Appeal. That thismeant that both lower courts did not consider the constitution,proceedings or report of the Dr. Pamela Committee’s decision tocancel the applicant’s diploma. Counsel urged court toconsider the Principle in the case of Bantariza V HabreInternational Trading Co Ltd [2002]2 EA 315 (SCU)at pp319-320 which is to the effect that a party is not entitled torely on an issue or cause of Action different from her originalcase. He further relied on the case of R V Sirasi Bachumira(1936)3_ EACA 40 at page 41 which is to the effect thatadditional evidence should not be taken to fill a gap in theprosecution’s case,Counsel argued that the applicant has not attached theadditional evidence thereby failing to meet the condition raisedin the authorities he raised and therefore does not deserve tohave the order to be made in his favor.Counsel further submitted that the applicant delayed inbringing the application which was in breach of the conditionin the Semogerere (supra) case. The application was brought 6months later.He also averred that the applicant is misleading court becausein his notice of motion, he sought to adduce Dr Pamelacommittee report and no further evidence is sought to beadduced however his affidavit in rejoinder reveals that heintends to adduce the minutes, and the record of proceedingsof the Dr. Pamela Committee. Counsel stated that this wascontrary to r. 42 and 43 of this court’s rules and the ruling ofKatureebe JSC (as he then was) in the case of HorizonCoaches Ltd V Rurangaranga & Anor [2010]1 Ea.77 (SCU),“a\\x0c1421,28at pp. 78 d & 83 c-f. In that case, the learned Justice observedas follows:-“To my mind, the import of these two Rules is that when onefiles a formal application to Court, ie. Notice of Motion, thegrounds for that application must be stated in the body of thatmotion. The affidavit is evidence of facts that support thegrounds that have been stated in the Notice of Motion. It iswrong for an applicant to direct this court that the grounds forhis application are to be found in the supporting affidavit”,Counsel also stated that the intended evidence is documentaryevidence and if the applicant is allowed to adduce the evidence,it would suffice for him to incorporate it in a supplementaryrecord of Appeal under r. 86(3)5 of the Rules of this court.Counsel stated that court should note the altered conditionparticularly the fact that the applicant’s diploma has now beencancelled and to make the observation that his pending appealis an exercise in futility since what had been sought to preventhas now already taken place.Counsel prayed that the application is dismissed with costs.RejoinderCounsel for the applicant reiterated his earlier submissions.CONSIDERATION BY COURTWe have considered the background of this application, thesubmissions of counsel, the evidence on record, the authoritiescited and the law.It is trite that in Civil Appeals under rule 30 of the Rules of thisCourt, this Court does not have discretion to take additional17\\x0c14212835evidence. The general principle is that the appellate Courtshould not travel outside the record of the lower court andcannot take additional any evidence on appeal.Another principle is that there must be an end to litigation,However, it is now Settled that there are circumstance underwhich additional evidence may be taken. This is Provided underRules 2 (2) of the Rules of this Court. It Provides as follows:-The catch word in the above provision is “nothing in theserules” shall be taken to limit or affect the inherent power of thisCourt. We agree that rule 30 (a) does not allow this Court totake additional evidence on appeal, however thatnotwithstanding, rule 2 (2) stipulates that even if a certain ruleprovides for a particular subject, the inherent Powers shalloverride any provision in the rule. The duty of this Court being40\\x0c14212835iii, It must be evidence which is credible in the sensethat it is Capable of belief;iv. The evidence must be such that, if given, it wouldProbably have influence on the result of the case,be brought without undue delay.This Court continued to explain these Principles ag follows:-“These exceptional circumstances have remained the standtaken by the Courts, for obvious reasons that there wouldbe no end to litigation unless a court can expect a party toput its full case before the court. We must stress that forIn addition, in the case of Karmali Tarmuhamed & anr Vs LHLakhani & Company (1958), Ea. 567, 568, it was heldinteraliq that;\\x0c14212835Lastly in Commissioner Land Registration & another vEmmanuel Lukwajju, Civil Application No. 12 of 2016, thiscourt held interalia that:-“It is now settled that according to the decisions of thiscourt in a number of cases including the ones cited in thisapplication, that Rule 2(2) of the Rules of this Court givesthis Court the power to admit additional evidence in so farRules, will invoke its inherent power under rule 2 (2) inexercise of its duty as final appellate court to justify the grantof leave to adduce additional evidence. This court is guided bythe principles set out in Attorney General VS Paul KawangaSemogerere & another (supra), followed in the case of“Attorney General & Inspector General of Government vAfric Cooperative Society Ltd, (supra) Setting out usefulguideline in determining application for adducingadditional evidence”.Turning to the present application, the gist of the application isthat the applicant should be allowed to introduce furtherevidence in the form of the report of the sub-committee of themanagement committee of the respondent dated 30/11/2015to explain the Forensic Audit of the Bar Course Examinationfor the period 2004/2005 to 2010/2011 which was notavailable during the proceeding in the High Court and theCourt of Appeal on the ground that it would assist the SupremeCourt to determine the disputes between the parties to itslogical conclusion and ensure that justice is not only done butalso seen to be done.\\x0c14at2835Upon careful analysis of the submissions of both counsel, it isclear from the record that what the applicant intends to adduceas additional evidence was actually not in place at both thetime of the proceeding in the High Court and the Court ofAppeal. It is clear from the record that the investigation by Dr.Pamela committee and _ its ensuring report and_ themanagement committee’s 98th meeting and its minutes werefuture events that had not occurred at the time of hearingbefore the two lower courts.We also agree with the respondent that it was grosslyerroneous and misleading for the applicant to state thatevidence about those events was in the possession of therespondent.The intended evidence at the time of filing and hearing of theapplicant’s case in the said two courts, was not available, couldnot be obtained by the applicant at the material time. Thus itcould not be said to be crucial, necessary, credible material orrelevant for the purpose of his appeal before this Court.By the time the two lower courts considered and disposed ofthe applicant’s case, no final decision had been made by therespondent against the applicant. Subsequently a final decisionwas made by the respondent against the applicant. However, itdoes not explain the Audit Report that was not before the twolower courts and does not fit within the additional evidence.The respondent’s decision to cancel the applicant’s DiplomaWas passed on 26/2/2016 and the applicant sat back until26/6/2016 when he applied for the documents that heintended to adduce as additional evidence.We accordingly agree with the respondent’s submissions thatthe applicant’s interest is to pursue new issues or causes ofaction that did not feature at the trial or in the Court of Appeal.Although this court possesses power to take additionalZi\\x0c142128a5evidence, in the present case, no such exceptionalcircumstances do exist to warrant the taking of such evidence.In the circumstances this application must fail. We also faultthe applicant for filing in court very long meandering pleadings.The pleadings were wordy, argumentative and repetitive (77grounds) which was a blatant violation of the rules and practiceof this court and is thus improper and unacceptable. A partfrom being unnecessarily lengthy, the affidavit also put forwardgrounds which should have been in the main appeal. Thepropriety of affidavits was recently discussed by this Court inthe case of Male Mabirizi Kiwanuka v Attorney General,Constitutional Appeal No. 2 of 2018. This Court had this tosay:-“On the issue of whether the affidavits of the applicant areargumentative, narrative and contain hearsay andconjectures, Order 19 Rule 3 of the Civil Procedure Rulesprovides that:Matters to which affidavits shall be confined.1. Affidavits shall be confined to such facts as thedeponent is able of his or her own knowledge to prove,except on interlocutory applications, on whichstatements of his or her belief may be admittedprovided that the grounds thereof are stated.2.The costs of every affidavit which shall unnecessarilyset forth matters of hearsay or argumentative matteror copies of or extracts from documents shall, unlessthe Court otherwise directs, be paid by the party filingthe affidavit, (underling for emphasis).In the instant application, the affidavit in support contains94 paragraphs and the supplementary affidavit contain 67paragraphs. The affidavit in rejoinder contains 103paragraphs. This makes a total of 264 paragraphs. The22\\x0c142128length of the affidavits by itself is not the issue but we findthat the contents are argumentative and prolix. Anaffidavit as we understand it is meant to adduce evidenceand not to argue the application. We find that theaffidavits of the applicant fall short of meeting thisstandard. They argue the case instead of laying down theevidence to be relied on in deciding the application”.All in all, we find no plausible arguments to sustain thisapplication to adduce additional evidence. We accordingly findthat this is not a befitting case to allow additional evidence. Theapplication is accordingly dismissed with costs to therespondent.Dated at Kololo this day of. SJ.
